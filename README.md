# A simple full stack application

**Using:**
- Python 3.8
- React
- PostgresQL

## How to use
(Part 1) To run the web app:
- Navigate to the `app` directory
- Run `npm start` in the command line

## Development notes
For this simple application using React, Python and PostgresQL I started by implementing the basic framework and design for the React frontend with 5 cards displaying content from the JSON and images.
I aimed to approach the task and requirements sequentially by identifying the basic features being requested and how I would divide work and functionality.
