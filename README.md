## Development notes
I first aimed to approach the task and requirements sequentially by identifying the basic features being requested and how I would separate the various features and their functions.
As this is the first web project I have used React in, I was challenged to learn the new framework and its features as I went along. I found that while my prior experience of web development using HTML/CSS/JS and jQuery was useful in planning out the implementation, translating the implementation into React code added to the challenge.
