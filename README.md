# A simple full stack application

**Using:**
- Python 3.10
  - Starlette
- React.js
- PostgresQL

## How to use
(Part 1) To run the front end web app:
- Navigate to the `app` directory
- Run `npm start` in the command line

...

## Development notes
I first aimed to approach the task and requirements sequentially by identifying the basic features being requested and how I would separate the various features and their functions.
As this is the first web project I have used React in, I was challenged to learn the new framework and its features as I went along. I found that while my prior experience of web development using HTML/CSS/JS and jQuery was useful in planning out the implementation, translating the implementation into React code added to the challenge.

Designing and building the web API was a more familiar experience as I have used Python for API interaction and building previously. I have never used Starlette before but found it fairly easy to learn and start using. There were some issues with poor documentation hindering implementation but overall I did not find it difficult to understand the requirements and how to realise them.

Though in the end I was unable to finish properly connecting the front end and back end components or set up the Docker microservices within the 2-week period I spent on the task I found this a very fun and useful exercise to practice full stack development skills and learn new libraries and technologies.
